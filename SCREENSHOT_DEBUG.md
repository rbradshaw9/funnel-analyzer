# Screenshot Pipeline Investigation & Fix

## Problem Statement
Screenshots are showing placeholders in the UI instead of actual page captures. Need to trace the full pipeline from capture ‚Üí upload ‚Üí save ‚Üí display ‚Üí AI analysis.

---

## Pipeline Flow (Expected)

```
1. Playwright Browser Launch
   ‚Üì
2. Navigate to URL + Capture Screenshot (screenshot.py)
   ‚Üì
3. Convert to Base64
   ‚Üì
4. Upload to S3 (storage.py)
   ‚Üì
5. Get Public S3 URL
   ‚Üì
6. Save URL to Database (analysis_pages.screenshot_url)
   ‚Üì
7. Send Base64 to OpenAI Vision API (openai_service.py)
   ‚Üì
8. Frontend Fetches Analysis (includes screenshot_url)
   ‚Üì
9. Next.js Image Component Renders S3 URL
```

---

## Code Review Findings

### ‚úÖ WORKING: Screenshot Capture (backend/services/screenshot.py)
```python
async def analyze_above_fold(self, url: str) -> Dict:
    # Captures FULL PAGE screenshot
    screenshot_bytes = await page.screenshot(
        type='png',
        full_page=True  # ‚úì Captures entire page
    )
    screenshot_base64 = base64.b64encode(screenshot_bytes).decode('utf-8')
    return {'screenshot': screenshot_base64, 'visual_elements': visual_data}
```
**Status**: Code looks correct. Playwright configured with proper args.

---

### ‚úÖ WORKING: S3 Upload (backend/services/storage.py)
```python
async def upload_base64_image(
    self,
    *,
    base64_data: str,
    content_type: str = "image/png",
    prefix: str = "screenshots/",
) -> Optional[StoredObject]:
    # Decodes base64
    binary = base64.b64decode(base64_data)
    
    # Generates unique key
    key = f"{prefix}{uuid.uuid4().hex}.png"
    
    # Uploads to S3
    self._client.put_object(
        Bucket=self._config.bucket,
        Key=key,
        Body=binary,
        ContentType=content_type,
        ACL="public-read"  # Or None if bucket doesn't support ACLs
    )
    
    # Builds public URL
    url = self._build_public_url(key)
    return StoredObject(key=key, url=url)
```
**Status**: Code looks correct. Returns URL from `_build_public_url()`.

**Possible Issues**:
1. ‚ùì S3 credentials not configured in Railway environment variables
2. ‚ùì Bucket name incorrect or doesn't exist
3. ‚ùì Bucket not publicly readable (CORS/bucket policy)
4. ‚ùì Base URL configuration missing

---

### ‚úÖ WORKING: Database Save (backend/services/analyzer.py)
```python
# Line 330 - Upload screenshot
if screenshot_base64 and storage_service:
    screenshot_asset = await storage_service.upload_base64_image(
        base64_data=screenshot_base64,
        content_type="image/png",
    )
    if screenshot_asset:
        screenshot_url = screenshot_asset.url  # ‚úì Gets URL from S3
        logger.info(f"‚úì Screenshot uploaded: {screenshot_url}")

# Line 465 - Save to database
analysis.pages = [
    AnalysisPage(
        url=page["url"],
        screenshot_url=page.get("screenshot_url"),  # ‚úì Saved to DB
        screenshot_storage_key=page.get("screenshot_storage_key"),
        ...
    )
    for page in analysis_result["pages"]
]
```
**Status**: Code looks correct. URL is saved to `analysis_pages.screenshot_url`.

**Possible Issues**:
1. ‚ùì `storage_service` is None (not initialized)
2. ‚ùì `screenshot_base64` is None (capture failed)
3. ‚ùì Migration didn't run (screenshot_url column doesn't exist)

---

### ‚úÖ WORKING: AI Vision Integration (backend/services/openai_service.py)
```python
# Line 104-116
if screenshot_base64:
    user_message_content.append({
        "type": "text",
        "text": main_prompt
    })
    user_message_content.append({
        "type": "image_url",
        "image_url": {
            "url": f"data:image/png;base64,{screenshot_base64}",
            "detail": "high"
        }
    })
```
**Status**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED - Screenshots ARE being sent to OpenAI vision API with proper format.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS INVESTIGATION: Frontend Display (frontend/components/PageAnalysisCard.tsx)
```tsx
{page.screenshot_url ? (
  <Image
    src={page.screenshot_url}  // Rendering S3 URL
    alt={`Screenshot of ${page.url}`}
    fill
    onError={(e) => {
      console.error('Failed to load screenshot:', page.screenshot_url)
      // Shows fallback
    }}
  />
) : (
  // Shows "Screenshot capture in progress..." placeholder
  <div className="text-center">
    <p>Screenshot capture in progress...</p>
    <p>Screenshots will appear when S3 storage is configured</p>
  </div>
)}
```

**Possible Issues**:
1. ‚ùì `page.screenshot_url` is null/undefined (not in API response)
2. ‚ùì S3 URL is correct but image fails to load (CORS issue)
3. ‚ùì Next.js Image component not configured for external S3 domain
4. ‚ùì S3 bucket blocks public read access

---

## Diagnostic Steps

### Step 1: Check Railway Environment Variables
```bash
# Railway Dashboard ‚Üí funnel-analyzer-backend ‚Üí Variables
AWS_S3_BUCKET=funnel-analyzer-pro  # ‚úì Should exist
AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...  # ‚úì Must be set
AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=***  # ‚úì Must be set
AWS_S3_REGION=us-east-1  # ‚úì Should match bucket region
AWS_S3_BASE_URL=https://funnel-analyzer-pro.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com  # OR custom domain
```

### Step 2: Check Railway Logs for Screenshot Upload
```bash
# Look for these log messages:
‚úì Screenshot uploaded for https://example.com: https://...
Screenshot URL preview: https://funnel-analyzer-pro.s3...

# OR error messages:
‚ö†Ô∏è S3 storage not configured - screenshots will NOT be saved
Failed to upload screenshot for https://example.com: ...
```

### Step 3: Check Database for Screenshot URLs
```sql
-- Run in Railway PostgreSQL console
SELECT 
    id,
    url,
    screenshot_url,
    screenshot_storage_key
FROM analysis_pages
WHERE analysis_id = (SELECT id FROM analyses ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1);
```

**Expected Result**:
- `screenshot_url`: `https://funnel-analyzer-pro.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/screenshots/abc123.png`
- `screenshot_storage_key`: `screenshots/abc123.png`

**If NULL**: Screenshot upload failed or storage service not configured.

### Step 4: Test S3 URL Directly
```bash
# Copy a screenshot_url from database
# Paste into browser: https://funnel-analyzer-pro.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/screenshots/abc123.png

# Should: Display the screenshot image
# If 403 Forbidden: Bucket policy doesn't allow public read
# If 404 Not Found: File wasn't actually uploaded
# If CORS error: Need to add frontend domain to bucket CORS config
```

### Step 5: Check Next.js Image Configuration
```js
// frontend/next.config.js
module.exports = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'funnel-analyzer-pro.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com',
        // OR
        hostname: '*.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com',
        // OR
        hostname: '*.amazonaws.com',  // Broad but works
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

**If missing**: Next.js will block external images from S3.

### Step 6: Check S3 Bucket Configuration

#### Bucket Policy (Public Read)
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::funnel-analyzer-pro/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### CORS Configuration
```json
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD"],
    "AllowedOrigins": [
      "https://funnelanalyzerpro.com",
      "https://www.funnelanalyzerpro.com",
      "http://localhost:3001"
    ],
    "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]
```

#### Block Public Access Settings
```
Block all public access: OFF
Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLs): OFF
Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLs): OFF
Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new public bucket or access point policies: OFF
Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any public bucket or access point policies: OFF
```

## Most Likely Issues (Ranked)

### 1. üî¥ HIGH PROBABILITY: S3 Environment Variables Not Set in Railway
**Symptom**: Logs show `‚ö†Ô∏è S3 storage not configured`

**Fix**: Add to Railway environment variables:
```
AWS_S3_BUCKET=funnel-analyzer-pro
AWS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...
AWS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
AWS_S3_REGION=us-east-1
```

---

### 2. üü° MEDIUM PROBABILITY: Next.js Image Domain Not Whitelisted
**Symptom**: Browser console shows `Invalid src prop ... hostname not configured under images in next.config.js`

**Fix**: Add to `frontend/next.config.js`:
```js
images: {
  remotePatterns: [
    {
      protocol: 'https',
      hostname: '*.amazonaws.com',
    },
  ],
}
```

---

### 3. üü° MEDIUM PROBABILITY: S3 Bucket Not Publicly Readable
**Symptom**: Direct S3 URL returns 403 Forbidden

**Fix**: Add bucket policy for public read access (see above).

---

### 4. üü¢ LOW PROBABILITY: Database Migration Didn't Run
**Symptom**: `screenshot_url` column doesn't exist

**Fix**: Run migrations:
```bash
# Railway should auto-run migrations on deploy
# But can manually trigger:
railway run python -m backend.db.migrations
```

---

## Action Plan

### Immediate Tasks
1. [ ] Check Railway environment variables for S3 config
2. [ ] Check Railway logs for screenshot upload success/failure
3. [ ] Query production database for screenshot_url values
4. [ ] Test S3 URL directly in browser
5. [ ] Verify Next.js image configuration
6. [ ] Check S3 bucket policy and CORS

### If S3 Not Configured
1. [ ] Get AWS credentials from team/create new IAM user
2. [ ] Create/configure `funnel-analyzer-pro` bucket
3. [ ] Set bucket policy for public read
4. [ ] Add CORS configuration
5. [ ] Add env vars to Railway
6. [ ] Redeploy backend

### If S3 IS Configured But Not Working
1. [ ] Check bucket name matches env var
2. [ ] Verify IAM user has s3:PutObject permission
3. [ ] Test manual upload with AWS CLI
4. [ ] Review Botocore errors in logs
5. [ ] Check if ACL is supported (some buckets block ACLs)

---

## Testing Checklist

After fixes, verify:
- [ ] Run new analysis
- [ ] Check logs for "‚úì Screenshot uploaded"
- [ ] Check database for screenshot_url
- [ ] Test S3 URL in browser (should show image)
- [ ] Frontend shows actual screenshots (not placeholders)
- [ ] Multiple pages all have screenshots
- [ ] Re-run analysis also captures screenshots
