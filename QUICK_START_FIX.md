# Authentication Fix - Quick Start

## What's Wrong?

1. ✅ **Backend works** - Login fixed (asyncpg issue resolved in commit 9a3d55b)
2. ❌ **Old admin interface** - `/admin` path serves outdated jQuery files
3. ⚠️ **Missing env vars** - Railway needs admin credentials
4. ⚠️ **Frontend not connected** - Vercel doesn't know where backend is

## The Fix (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables to Railway

**Go to**: Railway Dashboard → Your Project → Variables

**Add these**:
```
DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL = ryan@funnelanalyzerpro.com
DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD = FiR43Tx2-
DEFAULT_ADMIN_NAME = Funnel Analyzer Admin
```

**Then**: Click "Redeploy" on the backend service

---

### Step 2: Get Your Railway Backend URL

**Go to**: Railway Dashboard → Backend Service

**Look for**: Public URL (looks like `https://funnel-analyzer-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`)

**Copy it** - you'll need it for the next steps

---

### Step 3: Test the Backend Works

Run this command (replace `YOUR_RAILWAY_URL`):

```bash
./test_auth.sh https://YOUR_RAILWAY_URL
```

Or manually:

```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR_RAILWAY_URL/api/auth/admin/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"ryan@funnelanalyzerpro.com","password":"FiR43Tx2-"}'
```

**Expected**: You get a JSON response with `"token": "eyJ..."`

**If it fails**: Check Railway logs and verify env vars are set

---

### Step 4: Connect Vercel Frontend to Railway

**Go to**: Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables

**Add or update**:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = https://YOUR_RAILWAY_URL
```

(Use the Railway URL from Step 2)

**Then**: Go to Deployments → Click "..." → Redeploy

---

### Step 5: Remove Old Admin Deployment

**Go to**: Vercel Dashboard

**Look for**: Multiple projects - you might have two:
- `funnel-analyzer` (Next.js - keep this)
- `funnel-analyzer-admin` or similar (old admin - DELETE this)

**If you find it**: Delete or disable the old admin project

**Or**: Add a redirect in `frontend/vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/admin",
      "destination": "/",
      "permanent": false
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Test It Works

1. Go to `https://funnelanalyzerpro.com`
2. Find the login form
3. Login with:
   - Email: `ryan@funnelanalyzerpro.com`
   - Password: `FiR43Tx2-`
4. ✅ You should be logged in and see admin features

**Try registering a new user too:**
1. Click "Sign Up"
2. Enter any email/password
3. ✅ Should create account and login

---

## If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check Railway:
```bash
# View logs
railway logs

# Check if admin was created
curl https://YOUR_RAILWAY_URL/health/db
```

### Check Vercel:
1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
2. Try to login
3. Look at API requests - where are they going?
4. Check if `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is correct

### Check Environment:
- Railway has: `DEFAULT_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- Vercel has: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- Both services redeployed after env var changes
