## Current State Summary

**What's Working:**
‚úÖ Comprehensive data collection (screenshots, performance, AI analysis)
‚úÖ Beautiful presentation with clear hierarchy
‚úÖ Actionable recommendations with screenshot context
‚úÖ Export functionality
‚úÖ Version tracking

**What's Missing:**
‚ùå Implementation tracking (no way to mark recommendations complete)
‚ùå ROI justification (no revenue impact calculation)
‚ùå Comparison context (no competitor benchmarking)
‚ùå Progress visualization (can't see improvement over time)
‚ùå Team collaboration (can't assign recommendations, add comments)

**Biggest Opportunity:**
**Close the implementation loop** - Reports are valuable, but showing ROI from implemented changes creates retention and referrals. Build the checklist + re-run + diff comparison flow.

---

## Recommended Priority Order

1. **Implementation Checklist** (2 hours) - Drives retention
2. **ROI Calculator** (3 hours) - Justifies cost
3. **Visual Diff on Re-run** (4 hours) - Proves value
4. **Competitor Comparison** (4 hours) - Drives urgency
5. **Export Formats** (3 hours) - Increases sharing

**Total:** ~16 hours to transform from "interesting report" to "indispensable tool"
