# ThriveCart URL Update Checklist

## ‚úÖ Completed (Local & Code)
- [x] Updated `frontend/lib/externalLinks.ts` with new URLs
- [x] Updated `frontend/.env.example`
- [x] Updated `frontend/.env.local`
- [x] Fixed `/admin` redirect loop - now shows login prompt
- [x] Committed and pushed to GitHub

## üîÑ Required: Vercel Environment Variables

You need to update these in your Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/[your-username]/funnel-analyzer/settings/environment-variables

2. Update or add these variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASIC_CHECKOUT_URL=https://ignitiongo.thrivecart.com/funnel-analyzer-basic/
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PRO_CHECKOUT_URL=https://ignitiongo.thrivecart.com/funnel-analyzer-pro/
   ```

3. Redeploy the frontend (Vercel will auto-deploy from the git push, but you may want to verify)

## üìã ThriveCart Configuration

Update your ThriveCart webhook settings with the correct callback URL:

**Webhook URL:**
```
https://api.funnelanalyzerpro.com/api/webhooks/thrivecart
```

**Success Page URLs** (in each product):
- Basic Plan: `https://funnelanalyzerpro.com/success?plan=basic`
- Pro Plan: `https://funnelanalyzerpro.com/success?plan=pro`

## üß™ Testing

After Vercel deployment:

1. **Test Basic Plan Checkout:**
   - Go to https://funnelanalyzerpro.com/pricing
   - Click "Choose Basic" button
   - Should redirect to: https://ignitiongo.thrivecart.com/funnel-analyzer-basic/

2. **Test Pro Plan Checkout:**
   - Click "Choose Pro" button
   - Should redirect to: https://ignitiongo.thrivecart.com/funnel-analyzer-pro/

3. **Test Admin Login:**
   - Go to https://funnelanalyzerpro.com/admin
   - Should show login prompt (not redirect to home)
   - Click "Sign In" button
   - Login with ryan@funnelanalyzerpro.com / FiR43Tx2-
   - Should show admin dashboard

## üîç Admin Page Fix

The `/admin` page was redirecting to home because it checked for a token on load and redirected if not found. 

**Fixed behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Shows professional login prompt when not authenticated
- ‚úÖ Login button opens AuthModal
- ‚úÖ After login, admin dashboard loads automatically
- ‚úÖ Clear messaging about admin access requirements

## üìù Notes

The jQuery errors (`GET /env/ 404`) you saw are unrelated - they appear to be from a browser extension trying to load environment files. They won't affect functionality.
