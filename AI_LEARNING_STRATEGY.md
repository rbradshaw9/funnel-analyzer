# AI Learning & Improvement Strategy

## Current State
The AI uses GPT-4o with static prompts for analysis. Each analysis is independent - the AI doesn't learn from past analyses or user feedback.

## Strategies to Build Better Reports Over Time

### 1. **User Feedback Collection** (Quick Win)
Collect explicit feedback on every report to understand what's valuable:

**Implementation:**
- Add thumbs up/down on each recommendation
- Star rating for overall report quality
- "Was this helpful?" buttons on specific insights
- Optional comment field for detailed feedback

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE report_feedback (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    analysis_id INTEGER REFERENCES analyses(id),
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    overall_rating INTEGER, -- 1-5 stars
    thumbs_up BOOLEAN,
    feedback_text TEXT,
    helpful_sections JSONB, -- {"headline": true, "cta": true, "design": false}
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Benefits:**
- Identify which recommendations users find most actionable
- Discover patterns in low-quality outputs
- Guide prompt improvements based on real user needs

---

### 2. **Analysis Quality Metrics** (Medium Effort)
Track objective quality indicators to measure AI performance:

**Metrics to Track:**
- **Specificity Score**: Are recommendations concrete or generic?
  - Good: "Change headline to: 'Get 50% More Leads in 30 Days'"
  - Bad: "Improve the headline"
  
- **Consistency Score**: Do scores align with feedback content?
  - If design score is 45/100, feedback should mention specific design issues
  
- **Completeness**: Are all required sections filled with substance?
  - Check for placeholder text like "N/A" or empty arrays
  
- **Hallucination Detection**: Does the AI reference elements that don't exist?
  - Cross-check CTA recommendations against actual CTAs found

**Implementation:**
```python
def evaluate_analysis_quality(analysis: Dict) -> Dict:
    """Post-analysis quality check."""
    quality_metrics = {
        "specificity_score": check_specificity(analysis),
        "consistency_score": check_score_alignment(analysis),
        "completeness_score": check_completeness(analysis),
        "hallucination_count": detect_hallucinations(analysis),
    }
    
    # Store metrics for later analysis
    save_quality_metrics(analysis_id, quality_metrics)
    
    # Flag low-quality reports for manual review
    if quality_metrics["specificity_score"] < 0.6:
        flag_for_review(analysis_id, "Low specificity")
    
    return quality_metrics
```

---

### 3. **Prompt Engineering Evolution** (Ongoing)
Use feedback data to continuously refine prompts:

**A. Version Prompts:**
```python
PROMPT_VERSIONS = {
    "v1.0": "original_prompt.txt",
    "v1.1": "improved_specificity.txt",
    "v1.2": "reduced_hallucinations.txt",
}

# Track which version was used
analysis.prompt_version = CURRENT_PROMPT_VERSION
```

**B. A/B Test Prompts:**
- Run 50% of analyses with prompt A, 50% with prompt B
- Compare user feedback scores between versions
- Promote winning prompts to production

**C. Industry-Specific Refinement:**
- Track which industries get lowest ratings
- Create specialized prompts per industry
- Example: SaaS funnel prompts focus more on trial optimization

---

### 4. **Few-Shot Learning Examples** (High Impact)
Include real examples of excellent analyses in the prompt:

**Implementation:**
```python
EXAMPLE_ANALYSES = {
    "sales_page": {
        "good_headline": "Change headline from 'Welcome' to 'Cut Your Email List Churn by 40% in 60 Days'",
        "good_cta": {
            "copy": "Start My 14-Day Free Trial",
            "location": "Above the fold, centered in hero section",
            "reason": "Creates urgency with trial period, removes friction with 'free'"
        },
        "good_design": {
            "area": "Hero section",
            "recommendation": "Add social proof - '10,000+ marketers trust us' badge with company logos",
            "impact": "Builds immediate credibility, expected 15-20% conversion lift"
        }
    }
}

# Inject examples into prompt
prompt += f"\n\nEXAMPLE OF EXCELLENT ANALYSIS:\n{EXAMPLE_ANALYSES['sales_page']}"
```

**Benefits:**
- AI learns what "good" looks like from real examples
- Encourages specific, actionable recommendations
- Maintains consistency across analyses

---

### 5. **Human Review & Curation** (Medium Effort)
Manually review and curate the best analyses:

**Process:**
1. Flag high-rated analyses (4-5 stars) for review
2. Expert reviews analysis for quality
3. Tag exceptional recommendations
4. Build library of "gold standard" examples

**Use Cases:**
- Training data for future model fine-tuning
- Examples in few-shot prompts
- Marketing testimonials ("See what our AI found...")

---

### 6. **Automated Improvement Loops** (Advanced)
Build systems that automatically refine prompts:

**A. Feedback-Driven Prompt Tuning:**
```python
async def analyze_feedback_patterns():
    """Weekly job to analyze feedback trends."""
    
    # Find common complaints
    low_rated = db.query("""
        SELECT feedback_text, analysis_id
        FROM report_feedback
        WHERE overall_rating <= 2
        AND feedback_text IS NOT NULL
    """)
    
    # Use GPT-4 to identify patterns
    patterns = await llm.analyze(f"""
        Analyze these negative feedback comments and identify common issues:
        {low_rated}
        
        Return categories of problems (e.g., "too generic", "missed obvious issues", "hallucinations")
    """)
    
    # Generate prompt improvements
    improvements = await llm.generate(f"""
        Based on these common issues: {patterns}
        Suggest specific additions to our analysis prompt to address them.
    """)
    
    # Notify team to review suggestions
    notify_team(improvements)
```

**B. Self-Healing Prompts:**
- When quality metrics drop below threshold, trigger auto-review
- AI analyzes recent low-quality outputs
- Suggests prompt refinements to prevent similar issues

---

### 7. **Fine-Tuning Custom Models** (Long-Term)
Eventually, create a specialized model trained on your domain:

**Data Collection:**
- **Input**: Scraped page content, screenshots, visual elements
- **Output**: High-quality analyses (human-reviewed)
- **Feedback**: User ratings and comments

**Requirements:**
- ~10,000+ high-quality analysis examples
- Consistent quality through human review
- Budget for OpenAI fine-tuning API

**Benefits:**
- Faster analysis (cheaper, smaller model)
- More consistent output quality
- Domain-specific knowledge baked in

---

### 8. **Comparative Learning** (Smart)
Learn from re-runs and version history:

**Implementation:**
```python
async def analyze_rerun_improvements(original_id: int, rerun_id: int):
    """Compare original and re-run to see if page improved."""
    
    original = get_analysis(original_id)
    rerun = get_analysis(rerun_id)
    
    # Did score improve?
    score_delta = rerun.overall_score - original.overall_score
    
    # Did they implement our recommendations?
    implemented = check_if_recommendations_implemented(
        original_recommendations=original.cta_recommendations,
        new_page_content=rerun.page_content
    )
    
    # Learn: Which recommendations actually worked?
    if score_delta > 5 and implemented:
        tag_as_successful_recommendation(original.recommendations)
        # Use these examples in future prompts
```

**Insights Gained:**
- Which types of recommendations users actually implement
- Which changes correlate with score improvements
- Real-world validation of AI suggestions

---

### 9. **Competitive Analysis Integration** (Advanced)
Compare user's funnel against their competitors:

**Data to Collect:**
- Industry benchmarks (avg. scores per industry)
- Common patterns in high-performing funnels
- A/B test winners from the ecosystem

**Usage:**
```python
# In prompt
industry_benchmark = get_industry_benchmark(industry="saas")
prompt += f"""
BENCHMARKING CONTEXT:
- Average SaaS funnel scores: {industry_benchmark}
- Top-performing SaaS funnels typically have: {top_patterns}
- Compare this funnel against industry standards in your analysis
"""
```

---

### 10. **Outcome Tracking** (Ultimate Validation)
Track real conversion improvements:

**Implementation:**
- Offer users ability to connect Google Analytics
- Track conversion rates before/after implementing recommendations
- Correlate which recommendations led to actual business results

**Database:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE outcome_tracking (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    analysis_id INTEGER,
    recommendation_id INTEGER,
    implemented_date TIMESTAMP,
    conversion_rate_before DECIMAL,
    conversion_rate_after DECIMAL,
    revenue_impact DECIMAL,
    user_attribution TEXT -- "This change increased signups by 23%"
);
```

**Benefits:**
- Prove ROI of recommendations
- Identify highest-impact recommendation types
- Use successful outcomes as case studies
- Weight future recommendations by proven effectiveness
